""I forgot to record this part, but here was my script:""
Hi, I’m Ekin, Welcome to our session. Just a brief introduction before we get started, our mobile app is called “UMN Bathroom Rating App”, which would help users locate nearby bathrooms,  find bathroom based on their needs, see and give rating for bathroom at the U, and lastly provide a streamline system to report issues. You are invited today to test out the design of our app.
Before we get started, we want to note 2 things. First of all, this is just the design of the app, some of the functionalities might not fully work as intended, and we will let you know at the specific tasks. Secondly, the most important thing to remember today is that you are doing the evaluation. You are not being evaluated in any way, and you don’t have to worry about making a mistake. If you have any trouble using the app, your experience will help us to identify usability issues so they can be fixed and others won’t have to struggle later. You can also feel free to opt out at any time. The usability testing should take about 10 minutes.
Let’s get started
So you have some context for evaluating the design, we'll give you some everyday tasks that people would complete. While you show us how you would complete these tasks, we want you to say out loud what you are doing. We are taking notes of your thoughts as you go. Please speak as clearly as possible about your experience. Say what you're looking for, and what you think of what you see. If there's anything you didn't expect, if something confuses you, or if there’s something you like as you’re going through the site, let us know.
Once you are ready, we can begin with the first tasks.
